### Hist-Equal Module
A style alignment module (Hist-Equal) inspired by histogram equalization is proposed. This module recalibrates feature maps based on their frequency information to align the styles of bitemporal images. This approach reduces false alarms caused by stylistic differences (pseudo-changes) from varying imaging conditions, without significantly increasing the model's complexity as seen in GAN-based methods

### Fusion-Difference
A novel fusion-difference calculation module (Fusion-Diff) is designed, which replaces traditional cross-temporal difference calculation with a "consistency difference" approach. It evaluates the differences for each temporal image before and after feature fusion with the other temporal image. This method effectively suppresses pseudo-changes caused by non-target objects while still capturing real changes.

### Multi-SSIM
A multi-scale Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) is introduced as a difference metric, replacing conventional distance measures. This method calculates differences within local windows at multiple scales instead of pixel by pixel. This design enhances robustness against noise and improves the model's ability to detect structural differences across targets of various sizesã€‚
